Clinical History

    * Medical history
    * Risk factors
    * Allergies, if relevant
    * Reason for exam, including medical necessity: [headache | stroke | dizziness | trauma]

Imaging Technique

    * Time of image acquisition
    * Imaging device [MR, CT]
    * Image acquisition parameters, such as device settings, patient positioning, interventions (e.g., Valsalva maneuver)


CT SPINE TECHNIQUE

 

This CT study consists of [#] mm contiguous axial images performed from [skull base - sacrum] to [skull base - sacrum].  Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were also performed.

 

MR SPINE TECHNIQUE

 

This MR study consists of multiple sagittal and axial images of the [cervical thoracic lumbar] spine utilizing [<T1, T2 and gradient echo>] acquisitions.

    * Contrast materials and other medications administered (including name, dose, route, and time of administration)
    * Radiation dose

Comparison

    * Date and type of previous exams reviewed, if applicable
