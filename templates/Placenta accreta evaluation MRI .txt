MR Placenta

MR imaging of the gravid uterus was performed for purposes of placental evaluation utilizing Axial, Sagittal, and Coronal T2-weighted single shot fast spin echo and steady state free precession images, Sagittal gradient echo T1 and T2-weighted images, and Axial diffusion weighted images through the pelvis.
