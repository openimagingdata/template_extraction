PROCEDURE:[ Enhanced , Unenhanced ] MRI Pelvis

CLINICAL INDICATION: [Prostate cancer]. 


TECHNIQUE: 
Using a phased array coil [with an endorectal coil] small field-of-view imaging of the prostate was performed using the following sequences; [axial T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, sagittal T2-weighted,oblique coronal T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted]. 

Axial T1-weighted images [with fat suppression] through the prostate were obtained before and [dynamically] after the intravenous administration of [  ] ml of [name of contrast agent].

Using a large field-of-view, the entire pelvis to the level of the aortic bifurcation was imaged with the following sequences;(post-contrast fat suppressed T1-weighted, diffusion weighted, fat suppressed T2-weighted, STIR]

COMPARISON: [date , None].


FINDINGS:

Image quality is [satisfactory/degraded by motion/etc].
